            <h2>Cookies Notice — Veridian Urban Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Veridian Urban Systems (“VUS,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) uses cookies and similar technologies to maintain
                platform security, improve performance, analyze usage patterns, and deliver a reliable user experience.
                This notice explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and the choices available to you.
            </p>

            <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website or access our platform. They
                help us recognize your browser, remember your preferences, and keep the platform functioning smoothly.
                <br>
                We also use technologies that operate like cookies—such as local storage, session storage, and tracking
                pixels. These serve similar functions and are included in this notice.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Why We Use Cookies</h2>
            <p>We rely on cookies for several core purposes:</p>
            <h3>Essential Operations</h3>
            <p>These cookies allow the platform to work. They support login functions, maintain session integrity,
                enable security features, and keep the system stable.</p>
            <h3>Performance and Analytics</h3>
            <p>We use analytics tools to understand how the platform is accessed and used. This helps us improve system
                performance, troubleshoot issues, and refine the quality of insights produced by VUS.</p>

            <h3>Preferences</h3>
            <p>Some cookies store basic user settings—such as language or display preferences—to create a consistent
                experience each time you log in.</p>

            <h3>Security and Fraud Prevention</h3>
            <p>Cookies assist in detecting abnormal activity, preventing unauthorized access, and protecting the
                integrity of our systems.
                We do <b> not </b>use cookies for targeted advertising or commercial tracking.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <p>Certain trusted service providers may place cookies on our platform to support analytics, security, and
                performance monitoring. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality and data-protection
                obligations.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
            <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block or restrict cookies</li>
                <li>Delete cookies already stored</li>
                <li>Configure alerts before cookies are placed</li>

            </ul>
            <p>If you disable essential cookies, parts of the platform may not function properly.</p>

            <h2>5. Changes to This Notice</h2>
            <p>We may update this Cookies Notice when necessary to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or
                platform features. Any revised version will appear on this page with an updated date.
            </p>
